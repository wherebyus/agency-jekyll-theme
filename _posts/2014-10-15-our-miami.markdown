description: When the Miami Foundation released its groundbreaking Our Miami report — a comprehensive overview of the city's challenges and opportunities — they needed to make the data come alive. We created an interactive experience for the report's launch that gave people guided experiences with data. From striking large-scale graphics with guides to explain the numbers, to a pop-up park, to a timelapse art installation of Miami commutes, to a DIY street design station — attendees experienced first-hand what the report detailed.
