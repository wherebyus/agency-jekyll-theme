description: Miami's growing startup scene has been attracting talent, capital and plenty of buzz during the past few years. With all that energy comes exponential needs for connection and communication. We worked with the Knight Foundation to create resources to help new arrivals get into the scene, find and hire talent, raise capital, or get involved in the community's existing organizations and events. With ongoing multimedia storytelling, and a toolkit of curated, community-submitted resources, the startup guide weaves together and provides entry into Miami's burgeoning startup community.
