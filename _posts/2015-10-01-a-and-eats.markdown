description: When the developers of Miami's Arts + Entertainment District were looking to bring in a new restaurant concept, they knew they needed more than an ad. We worked with them to design A+Eats&#58; The Search for Miami's Next Great Restaurant â€” a public contest to give a year of rent-free space and buildout to a local restaurateur with a fresh concept. The New Tropic promoted and managed the submission and review process, backed by four months of content and social media engagement on local restaurateurs and Miami's growing food scene. More than 100 people applied, and more than 5,000 locals participated in the public voting process. We produced a livestreamed finale cookoff at FIU's School of Hospitality, where a winner was chosen by a panel of restaurant owners, chefs, and food critics. We reached more than 500,000 locals with the Arts + Entertainment District, creating over 25,000 engagements.
